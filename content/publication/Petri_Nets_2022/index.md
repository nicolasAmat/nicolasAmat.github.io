abstract: "Kong, the Koncurrent places Grinder, is a tool designed to compute the concurrency relation of a Petri net by taking advantage of structural reductions. The specificity of Kong is to rely on a state space abstraction, called polyhedral abstraction in previous works, that involves a combination of structural reductions and linear arithmetic constraints between the marking of places."
