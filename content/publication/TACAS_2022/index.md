abstract: "We propose a semi-decision procedure for checking generalized reachability properties, on generalized Petri nets, that is based on the Property Directed Reachability (PDR) method. We actually define three different versions, that vary depending on the method used for abstracting possible witnesses, and that are able to handle problems of increasing difficulty. We have implemented our methods in a model-checker called SMPT and give empirical evidences that our approach can handle problems that are difficult or impossible to check with current state of the art tools."
