I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the IMDEA Software Institute,
working on new solving techniques for Presburger arithmetic. I am interested in
theoretical computer science, with a special interest in the theory and
applications of decision procedures for formal verification. I completed my PhD
at LAAS-CNRS, where I worked on new methods for taking advantage of Petri net
reductions with an SMT-based model checker.
